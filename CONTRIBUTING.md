# Contributing to ActiveUtils

We gladly accept bugfixes to this library. Please read the guidelines for reporting issues and submitting pull requests below.

### Reporting issues

- Include the version of ActiveUtils, Ruby, and ActiveSupport you are using.
- If you run into an unexpected exception, please include a stacktrace.
- Try to include a code snippet that demonstrates the problem.

### Pull request guidelines

1. [Fork it](http://github.com/Shopify/active_utils/fork) and clone your new repo
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b my_awesome_feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git add my/awesome/file.rb; git commit -m "Added my awesome feature"`)
4. Push your changes to your fork (`git push origin my_awesome_feature`)
5. Open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/shopify/active_utils/pulls)

The most important guidelines:

- All changes should be covered by tests.
- Your code should support all the Ruby versions and ActiveSupport versions we have enabled on Travis CI.
- Do not update the CHANGELOG, or the `ActiveUtils::VERSION` constant.

Final note: maybe you should also update the mirrored version in ActiveMerchant.

### Releasing

1. Check the [semantic versioning page](http://semver.org) for info on how to version the new release.
2. Update the  `ActiveUtils::VERSION` constant in **lib/active_utils/version.rb**.
3. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the new release with the date.
4. Tag the release commit on GitHub: `bundle exec rake tag_release`
5. Release the gem to rubygems using ShipIt
